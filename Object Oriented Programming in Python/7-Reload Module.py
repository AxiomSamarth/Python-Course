# this is the method of creating the object / variable for the method call and using that variable to call the method henceforth

from ex_module import *

# look here!! The name of the method is assigned to the variable without appending the paranthesis to the method name
baby = method

# and when the function variable is used to call the method, then the paranthesis is appended to the variable as baby()
baby()
