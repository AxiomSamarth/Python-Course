#	This program will teach you the implementation of lists 'vectors' in simple terms

l = [1,2,3,4,5] #initialization of list (comma separated values !)

print l 		#this will print the whole list



#		unlike arrays in C and java and other programming languages, lists can 
#		be heterogenous (list items belonging to different data types) 
#		in nature as shown in example below.


l1 = [1,2.5,'Samarth']

print l1
