# 	This program will teach you how to use boolean values for the flow
#	control in python

if(True):
	
	print 'Inside true block'
	

#	********************************************************************

#	    'True' and 'False' T and F in uppercase are the only possible boolean 
#		values that usually decide the flow of program.

#		So an if statement needs the following :
#		1. 'if' key word
#		2. followed by an expression that generated a boolean value or
#		   a boolean value as above
#		3. A colon
#		4. Next line a tab space creates am indentation which makes a 
#		   block and everything in that indentation form the if-clause
#		   statements.
#		5. An indent out will bring out of the nearest block.


#	********************************************************************	


print '\n\nAnother example'

if True:
	
	print '\nInside the if block'
	print '\nThis is another same indented sentence and hence within the if clause'
	
print '\n\nThis is one indent out and hence outside the if block!'
