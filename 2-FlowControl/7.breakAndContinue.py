#	This program will make us understand the break and continue statement!

	if(i == 10):

	else:
		
		continue
		
	print 'continue is executed and hence it reached end of the loop skipping all the in between codes in the body of the loop re-executing the while-clauses !!'
	
print 'Break executed !'	


#	******************************************************************

#		The loops will have the 'continue' statement in them by default !
#		sys.exit() can be used to terminate the program !
