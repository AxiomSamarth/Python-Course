#	This program depicts the usage of whileloop

i = 0

while (i<5):
	
	print i
	i = i + 1
	

#	********************************************************************

#		This is while loop
#		1. we need an initialized variable or an expression which generates
#		   boolean value.
#		2. Then 'while' keyword followed by condition.
#		3. Followed by a colon.
#		4. Then create indentation to create a block and write the body 
#		   of the while-clause!
#		5. There is no unary operators like ++ or --in python. So beware
#		   not to use them !	

#		There is no do-while in python ! While is designed to manage the
#		behaviour of do-while loop !
