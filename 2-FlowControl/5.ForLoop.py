#	This program shows the usage of for loop!

for i in range(5):
	
	print i
	
	
print 'Another way !'	

for i in range(5,10):
	
	print i
	
print '\n\nYet another way !'	

for i in range(1,11,1):
	
	print i
	
print '\n\nLet\'s  see another example !'	

for i in range (1,21,2):
	
	print i
	
	
	
	
#	********************************************************************

#		A typical for loop makes use of a control variable  'i' as in 		
#		above example and followed by range() function which takes upto
#		3 arguments!

#		range(a) where 'a' is an integer loop runs from 0 to a excluding 
#		'a'

#		range(a,b) runs the loop from a to b including 'a' but excluding
#		'b' with a default increment of 1 after every value of the
#		control variable

#		range(a,b,c) runs the loop from 'a' to 'b' excluding 'b' with an
#		increment of 'c' each time !

#		so the for loop has
#		1. 'for' keyword
#		2. control variable name like 'i' or 'key' or anything you wish
#		3. in 'keyword' , followed by range() function.

#		4. Use the required one type of range() function as explained above
#		5. a colon and in the next line write the loop-clauses forming 
#		   an indentation !
#		6. An indent out for the  codes will bring you out of the nearest 
#		   for-loop
