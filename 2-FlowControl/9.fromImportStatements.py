# 	This program will show the usage of from import statements of modules

from math import sqrt

a = sqrt(25)

print a

#	********************************************************************

#		If you have observed then while using the function sqrt() I have
#		not used the math. as prefix. This is the use of 'from' method 
#		of importing the modules !

#		We can use the functions directly without taking the reference
#		of the modules. But it is always better to use the previous
#		way of accessing module for easy debugging !
