The if-else statements works on the boolean values !


Boolean values are 'True' or 'False' !


The '0' or '' or null is always False and anything other than  theseis always true.


The condition that follows the 'if' keyword must generate a boolean value and based on the result, the block is executed !


In the series of if-else statements only one of the statements is executed and when one is executed then rest all the elif statements
are skipped and the program is continued with the next lines of codes!
