#		this program shows us how to concatenate two strings
#		and how to print combination of digits and strings


print 'Alice'+'Bob'

a = 'Samarth'
b = 'Poornima'

print '\n',a + b

print '\nA dozen means ', 12 , 'items'

print '\nA gross means ' + str(200) + ' items'

a = 'string'

print '\nNow let\'s concatenate',a


#	********************************************************************

#		Here you see that the comma is used to concatenate string and 
#		digits and when we use comma we need not typecast and when we
#		use plus symbol we need to typecast otherwise an TypeError is 
#		shown by the python interpreter.

#		The variable may also be put in place of values like 'a' in the
#		above example. If you are concatenating 'a' using plus symbol
#		then typecasting it as str(a) is very much necessary.

#		When a comma is used as the concatenating agent, automatically 
#		on either sides of the sandwiched digit or string being 
#		concatenated; a space is added and it is not added when plus
#		is used.
