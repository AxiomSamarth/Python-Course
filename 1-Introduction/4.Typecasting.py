#this program shows yoy how to typecast the variables

a = 10

b = float(a)

c = str(a)

print a

print '\n',b

print '\n',c

print '\nThe distinction is clear from the above output. I say this assuming you know any one programming language.'

#this is how it is typecasted ! int, float and str are the possible typecast.
